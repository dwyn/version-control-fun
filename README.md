1. Fork Repo!

2. Clone Repo!
3. Make a new branch and `cd` into branch.

4. Create a new markdown file
  - That file should be named after your team 
  - eg `team-name.md` sooo something like team-mini-microphone.md
  - You come up with your team name, I don't care 🤷🏾‍♂️ (Just nothing offensive please!)
  - List the names of everyone on the team

5. `git add <file_name>.md`

6. `git commit -m 'Your commit message'`

7. Merge with main `git merge <your-branch-name>`

8. Push changes to Github. `git push -u origin main`

Hey Im screwing everything up!
